# TODO
Make the full model [] () 
    1. Cut the Malconv into 2 parts 
        1. the Ms - convolution part @Current
        2. the Mf - classification part 
        -> Then connect them together just like normal :v

    2. Add the f aggregate function
        the average function
        takes n 128 dim input -> 1 128 dim output 


Validate the model [] (4h) @Next
Adjust the model [] (2h) 

Write the file parser backend in Python [] 
    Get the file then parse it into streams
    Pass that stream to the model 

Write the file parser front end [] () 
    input file 
    show result 

# DONE
Understand how the data works
Make our data work with the model
