# TODO
+ Process each file into a csv file [] (1h) @Current
    write a shellscript for that 

    + What really i want as the input of the model:
        we need a file label along with the streams labels [] @Current
            file name + benign/normal
        The dataset seperation is kinda wrong :v 

        -> have a separate summary files csv, that contains the file labels
        -> have a file csv, that contains the stream labels
        FileLevelModel Input x: a single file (meaning: ...)
        FileLevelModel Output a boolean value (benign, or normal)

        each file's streams contain in a csv file
        name of the csv file is the name of the ole files

        1. Keep the some columns [] @Current
        1. name
        2. stream label
        3. stream data from n to m
        2.



Validate the model [] (4h) @Next
Adjust the model [] (2h) 

Write the file parser backend in Python [] 
    Get the file then parse it into streams
    Pass that stream to the model 

Write the file parser front end [] () 
    input file 
    show result 

# DONE
+ Make the full model [X] () 
    1. Cut the Malconv into 2 parts 
        1. the Ms - convolution part [X] (1h) 
            NOTE: Test make sure it works 
        2. the Mf - classification part  [X] () 
            NOTE: Test make sure it works 

        -> Then connect them together just like normal :v [X]

    2. Add the f aggregate function [X] () 
        the average function
        takes n 128 dim input -> 1 128 dim output  [X]

        + Problem: 
            We have to change the data loader format [] (1h) @Current
                Into an array of streams 

Understand how the data works
Make our data work with the model
