how the data works
the label file have the filename then the label
the data is the raw binary file 
the stream will be generated from the data processor
    -> The stream didn't even have labels ??

We know the how the label looks like: 
    a file name + benign, normal tag

What's the pe data stream looks like ?? 
    -> 


The ExeDataset class in the provided code snippet is 

+ Inputs
    + fp_list:
        A list of file names 
    + data_path: The base directory path of the executables
        -> the actual file path = data_path + fp_list[idx] 

    + label_list: 
        A list of **LABELS CORRESPONDING TO EACH FILE IN FP_LIST**.

    + first_n_byte: 
        An integer specifying **THE NUMBER OF BYTES TO READ FROM EACH FILE**
        (default is 2,000,000 bytes).

+ Outputs
    + **RETURNS 1 TUPLE CONTAINING**:
        + 1. A numpy array representing the first first_n_byte bytes of the file, with each byte value incremented by 1.
        + 2. A numpy array containing the label associated with the file.

        -> (nparray(), nparray())

+ Example
    + Input:
        fp_list = ['file1.exe', 'file2.exe']
        data_path = '/path/to/files/'
        label_list = [0, 1]
        first_n_byte = 10

    + Output: 
        dataset[0] = (array([2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]), array([0]))
        dataset[1] = (array([/* bytes from file2.exe */]), array([1]))
